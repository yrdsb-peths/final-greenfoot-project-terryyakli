In my game, you are playing as an axolotl under the water. 

You need to collect your plants while avoiding fish. They will attack you.

If you get hurt from the fish you can eat worms to regenerate health. Be careful, the more plants you collect the faster the game will get.


Arrays can be found in  Axo.java @ lines 11-12, 12, 63, 71, 75, and more.
                        Fish.java @ lines 11, 41-42, and more.
